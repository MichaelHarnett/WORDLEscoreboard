# WORDLE SCOREBOARD
I send my wordle scores to my father, brother, and sister daily. It has become very competitive! I am building a little dashboard that will scan my iMessages and upload the appropriate data in one spot we can all access.
<br>
<br>
Unsure which deployment method will be used. I have some experience with streamlit sharing, but can use this as an opportunity to learn flask or some other method.
<br>
<br>
this readme will update as the project does as well. 
<br>
<br>
So I deployed with streamlit sharing to start displaying work, may use other methods moving forward.<br>
the app is available [Here] (https://share.streamlit.io/michaelharnett/wordlescoreboard/main/app.py) <br>
Right now there is a pie chart for total wins, and total losses, and individual guess counts similar to the site itself, and currently working on a side-by-side bar chart to compare everyone's guesses in one chart<br>

Right now I sized the graphs to look better on movile devices, since that is how everyone in my family is viewing it, the pie charts specifically look dispropotiantely small on desktop. In the future I can work on dynamic sizing, but for now it works!
