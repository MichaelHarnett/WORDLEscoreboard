# WORDLEscoreboard
I send my wordle scores to my father, brother, and sister daily. It has become very competitive! I am building a little dashboard that will scan my iMessages and upload the appropriate data in one spot we can all access.

Unsure which deployment method will be used. I have some experience with streamlit sharing, but can use this as an opportunity to learn flask or some other method.

this readme will update as the project does as well.
